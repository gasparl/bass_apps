        <p><b>Aim:</b>
            <br>You will be shown various images which you will need to categorize using keypresses in a response time task. The entire experiment takes around 30 minutes.</p>
        <p><b>Health Risks:</b>
            <br>Some of the images we are about to show you may be explicit and can depict violence. However, there are no known physical or psychological risks associated with participating in this study. </p>

        <p><b>Your Rights:</b>
            <br>You can stop participating in the study at any time without giving a reason (by closing or refreshing this website). In this case, all recorded data will be fully deleted. If you would like to know the
            results of the study, please contact the
            experimenter
            (claudia.kawai@univie.ac.at).</p>

        <p><b>Anonymity and Privacy:</b>
            <br>The results of the study are used and published for research purposes. The data do not provide any information about you personally. You will not be named and your identity will be kept strictly confidential. Even after you have
            participated (until publication), you can prohibit the use of your data.</p>

        <p><b>Consent:</b>
            <br>By clicking the "I consent" button, you declare that you have read and understood the information above. You confirm that you will be concentrating on the tasks and complete them to the best of your abilities. You agree
            to
            participating in this study and the subsequent analysis of your data by authorized personnel.</p>

            In the following you will see images presented one by one, in different colors.
            Press the key <b>"<span class="pos_key"></span>"</b> when you see an <b>positive image</b> (image depicting something positive), and press <b>"<span class="neg_key"></span>"</b> when you see a <b>negative image</b> (image depicting
            something negative).
            <br><br>
            The responses should be the same regardless of the color of the image.
            <br><br>
            We will start the experiment with a short practice round. You need a certain number of sufficiently fast correct responses for both positive and negative images. Otherwise you will have to repeat the practice round.
